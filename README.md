# Shrike

Shrike is a fork of ROS1. Its goal is to provide a developer experience similar to ROS1, maintaining compatibility with ROS1 packages while fixing many of the issues that have plagued ROS1.
We adopt a monorepo approach, with all modules and functionalities inside the same repository.
In addition, we plan to provide a broad away of support for platforms, starting with Ubuntu 24.04.
